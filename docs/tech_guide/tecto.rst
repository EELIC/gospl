==================================
Tectonic forcing
==================================

.. note::

  These forcing are user defined and could be either lithospheric or mantle induced but goSPL does not know which underlying process is inducing these changes and does not account for sediments and crust compression.


Uplift & subsidence
---------------------------------

In the most simple case of vertical-only displacements (*i.e.* uplift or subsidence), the model requires the declaration of successive events using :yaml:`start`, :yaml:`end` times and the tectonic rates map :yaml:`upsub` (in metres per year). This map is defined prior to the model run for goSPL spherical or 2D mesh as a  numpy zip array.

During the model run and for each time step, the prescribed rates are applied on all vertices of all partition by increasing or decreasing their elevation values following imposed local subsidence or uplift rates.


Horizontal advection
---------------------------------

The second, more complex, option consists in adding horizontal displacements (:yaml:`hdisp`). In this case, the user has to defined for each point of the grid the associated velocities (represented by displacement fields in both X,Y and Z coordinates) and advection could be performed based on different techniques.

Using **Upwind** or **IIOE scheme**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. important::
  
  These two approaches are designed for 2D meshes and have not been tested on global simulations.

The Upwind scheme offers a rapid solution to the advection problem but with potentially excessive diffusion when solved implicitly (`first-order upwind implicitly scheme <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168927414001032>`_).

Alternatively, the user can perform the advection of elevation and erosion by solving the advection equation based on a finite volume space discretization and a semi-implicit discretization in time called the Inflow-Implicit/Outflow-Explicit scheme and following the work from `Mikula & Ohlberger, 2014 <https://www.math.sk/mikula/mo-FVCA6.pdf>`_. 

Setting the approach for a given simulation is done in the input file by setting the `advect` key to either `upwind`, `iioe1` or `iioe2`.

.. note::

    In the IIOE approach, the outflow from a cell is treated explicitly while inflow is treated implicitly.

    Since the matrix of the system is determined by the inflow fluxes it is an M-matrix yielding favourable solvability and stability properties.

Both methods allow large time steps without losing stability and not deteriorating precision.

The IIOE is formally second order accurate in space and time for 1D advection problems with variable velocity and numerical experiments indicate its second order accuracy for smooth solutions in general.

.. note::

    Velocity at the face is taken to be the linear interpolation for each vertex (in a vertex-centered discretisation the dual of the delaunay triangulation (i.e. the voronoi mesh has its edges on the middle of the nodes edges)).

    Similarly we consider that the advected variable at the face is defined by linear interpolation from each connected vertex.

Two IOOE schemes are available the first one (`iooe1`)
uses the technique defined `here <https://www.math.sk/mikula/mo-FVCA6.pdf>`_, the second (`iooe2`) is more computationally demanding but should limit instabilities in regions with large advection velocities (see `paper <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168927414001032>`_).

Using the **semi-lagrangian scheme**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Used for global mesh, the horizontal advection (advect: `interp`) often corresponds to plate motions and can be obtained from plate-tectonic reconstruction software.

.. warning::

  Compared to vertical displacements applied at each time step, the horizontal advection for this method is only performed at the end of the specified tectonic interval (so usually of the order of several thousands to millions years).

.. note::
  
  Due to tectonic advection, the density of the surface nodes evolves over time, which leads to areas showing rarefaction or accumulation of nodes. In order for the finite volume scheme to remain accurate, local addition and deletion of nodes and remeshing of the triangulated spherical surface are therefore required. However, the remeshing process is computationally expensive and requires to rebuild not only the delaunay mesh but also the associated voronoi one and to redistribute the mesh and its vertices parameters with `PETSc <https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/>`_.

  To avoid remeshing, the initial mesh is assumed to remain fixed and the advected points are then used to interpolate the advected nodes informations (elevation, erosion, deposition, stratigraphic information...) onto the fixed ones using an inverse weighting distance approach and `SciPy cKDTree <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.cKDTree.html>`_. The number of points used for the interpolation is defined by the user in the input file (:yaml:`interp` field). This is an efficient approach but it might not be the most accurate one.


Flexural isostasy
---------------------------------

The flexural isostasy in goSPL is computed on a **regular grid**, and therefore required to perform a series of interpolation from and to the goSPL unstructured mesh.


.. figure:: ../images/flex.png
  :scale: 50 %
  :align: center

  Flexural isostasy can be produced in response to a range of geological loads (from `Wickert, 2016 <https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/9/997/2016/gmd-9-997-2016.pdf>`_).


**gFlex** for 2D simulations 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When running goSPL in 2D, it is possible to compute the flexural isostasy equilibrium based on topographic change. The function accounts for flexural isostatic rebound associated with erosional loading/unloading using `gFlex <https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/9/997/2016/gmd-9-997-2016.pdf>`_. 

.. important::

  The approach is performed in serial and therefore can be relatively slow depending on the simulation size.

It takes an initial (at time :math:`t`) and final topography (at time :math:`D + \Delta t`) (*i.e.* before and after erosion/deposition) and returns a corrected final topography that includes the effect of erosional/depositional unloading/loading. 

The approach solves the bi-harmonic equation governing the bending/flexure of a thin elastic plate floating on an inviscid fluid (the asthenosphere).

.. math::

  D \frac{d^4 w}{d^4 x} + \Delta \rho g w = q

where :math:`D` is the flexural rigidity,  :math:`w` is vertical deflection of the plate, :math:`q` is the applied surface load, and :math:`\Delta \rho = \rho_m âˆ’ \rho_f` is the density of the mantle minus the density of the infilling material.

**isoFlex** for global simulations 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A wrapper around `gFlex <https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/9/997/2016/gmd-9-997-2016.pdf>`_ to estimate global-scale flexural isostasy based on tiles distribution and projection in parallel.

.. note::
  
  This is not the most elegant method, but will probably do the trick for now...

The globe is divided into 142 overriding tiles to account for UTM projection distortions and `gFlex <https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/9/997/2016/gmd-9-997-2016.pdf>`_ is apply on each tile before reprojecting it back to spherical cartesian coordinates...

`isoFlex <https://github.com/Geodels/isoFlex>`_ uses the finite difference (FD) method from `gFlex <https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/9/997/2016/gmd-9-997-2016.pdf>`_ with the van Wees and Cloetingh (1994) ('vWC1994') option for the plate solution type.
